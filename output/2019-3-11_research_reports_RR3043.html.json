Is nocturia associated with subjective well-being and workplace engagement and productivity? What are the economic implications of nocturia?\n\n\n\nNocturia is a condition caused by reduced nocturnal bladder capacity and/or a large urine volume produced during the night. It is also relatively common, with up to 20 per cent of the overall population being affected, and its prevalence increases with age. Given its sleep-interrupting nature, nocturia is regarded to have negative implications for individuals' daytime functioning and is potentially associated with lower life satisfaction and reduced levels of workplace productivity. This study is one of the first to comprehensively examine of the associations between nocturia and a range of health, wellbeing, demographic and economic variables in a working-age population.\nOur results show a set of associations between nocturia and a range of conditions, outcomes and factors. On the one hand, it confirms in the working-age population what has been seen in other studies that focused more specifically on the older populations. We find that a range of chronic conditions are associated with nocturia, though our surveys do not capture all relevant chronic conditions. Not surprisingly, we see a strong association between nocturia and other sleep quality indicators such as the first interrupted period of sleep. On the other hand, our study can be more expansive about the economic and wellbeing effects of the condition given the range of data points that were collected in recent workplace surveys. Respondents who report two or more voids have lower work engagement, life satisfaction and lower work productivity resulting in lower individual wellbeing and costs to society and employers.\nKey Findings\n\nNocturia is a common and 'bothersome' condition, with two voids per night a critical threshold.Estimates on the prevalence of nocturia suggest that, even though its prevalence is increasing with age, it is a condition that also affects approximately up to one in ten individuals aged 45 or younger.\n\nA variety of demographic, lifestyle and health factors — which differ by age and gender — are associated with nocturia.The research findings confirm previous research based on older study populations that some of the examined demographic factors associated with nocturia are also relevant for the working-age population, including age, gender or ethnicity. Furthermore, we find that chronic health conditions — such as kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and hypertension — are associated with more frequent night time voids.\n\nNocturia is associated with higher levels of sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue.Across three sleep quality measures we find that the prevalence of nocturia is associated with self-reported poor sleep quality, higher levels of sleep interruption and higher levels of daytime fatigue, independent of age and gender of the respondent.\n\nNocturia is significantly associated with lower life satisfaction, work engagement and productivity.The empirical analysis presented in this study suggests that nocturia is associated with lower life satisfaction, work engagement and productivity in the working-age population, even after adjusting for many other factors that could determine these outcome variables, including sleep quality and duration.\n\nNocturia is associated with up to $79 billion of lost economic output per year across six countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Germany, Spain and Australia.\n\nRecommendation\n\nGiven the substantial economic implications of untreated nocturia, this should be a 'wake-up' call to diverse stakeholders — including patients, health-care providers and employers — of the importance of identifying and treating nocturia.\n\n\n\n Related Products \n\n\n\n\n\nNews Release\n\n\n\n\n News Release \nHow Two or More Trips to the Bathroom at Night Are Costing the UK Economy £4.5 Billion a Year\n\nMar 12, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Release\n\n\n\n\n News Release \nHow Two or More Trips to the Bathroom at Night Are Costing the U.S. Economy $44.4 Billion a Year\n\nMar 12, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Project \nHow trips to the bathroom at night affect health and productivity\n\nMar 12, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter One\nIntroduction\n\nChapter Two\nThe prevalence of nocturia, factors associated with the condition and possible consequences — a glance at the literature\n\nChapter Three\nQuantifying factors associated with nocturia and corresponding outcomes — data and methods\n\nChapter Four\nFactors associated with nocturia in the working-age population — demographics, lifestyle, co-morbidities and sleep\n\nChapter Five\nNocturia and the associations with life satisfaction, work engagement and impairment\n\nChapter Six\nQuantifying the macroeconomic implications associated with nocturia\n\nChapter Seven\nSummary and conclusion\n\nAppendix A\nFactors associated with nocturia in the working-age population: demographics, lifestyle, co-morbidities and sleep — corresponding regression output tables\n\nAppendix B\nNocturia and the associations with life satisfaction, workplace engagement and productivity — corresponding regression output tables\n\nAppendix C\nThe BHW and AIA surveys\n\nAppendix D\nDescription of the CGE model\n\n\n\n\nResearch conducted by\n\nRAND Europe\n\n\n\nThis research was prepared for Ferring Pharmaceuticals and conducted by RAND Europe.This report is part of the RAND Corporation research report series.
