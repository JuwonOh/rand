This has been accompanied by a growing interest in understanding how PPI can best be mobilised and enabled, and in how it can contribute positively to the research process and to impacts from it. The body of literature on these issues has expanded rapidly in the last decade. However, the evidence base on what works, how and why remains fragmented and inconclusive.\nRAND Europe was commissioned by The Healthcare Improvement Studies (THIS) Institute at the University of Cambridge to conduct a rapid review of the evidence base on PPI in research. This report reflects on what we know and on knowledge gaps. It aims to help inform THIS Institute's efforts to establish and implement an effective PPI strategy. It should also be of relevance to other organisations and initiatives seeking to involve patients and the public in research in a meaningful and effective way.\nBased on a rapid evidence assessment and interviews with experts, the report examines why and how patients and the public get involved with research, what enables meaningful involvement, associated challenges and potential enabling mechanisms, the impact of PPI, and the evaluation of this activity. Based on these insights, we provide a series of recommendations for THIS Institute and other organisations to inform strategies for engaging patients and the public.\nKey Findings\n\nMotivations for involvementPatients and the public engage with research for a variety of reasons spanning: (i) interest in a healthcare topic, often driven by personal experience of a disease or of the health service; (ii) altruistic motivations to contribute to a better healthcare system through research; (iii) a desire to influence and reflect patient perspectives in research; and (iv) a more general interest in research activity and in contributing to scientific knowledge.\n\nApproaches to involvementPPI in health research can take place across different stages of a research cycle and at the level of an individual project, a portfolio of projects or at the organisational level. The duration, frequency or regularity of patient and public engagement can range from ad hoc, task-based contributions to long-term engagement across the lifetime of a project or research organisation.\n\nChallenges, enablers and impactsChallenges to effective PPI in research relate to governance and management issues, the capacity of individuals to engage, administrative challenges and challenges related to culture, values and attitudes. However, the growing focus on and increased commitment to PPI within research over the past decade has also revealed some key enabling mechanisms and rewards (e.g. feedback on contributions and on project progress and impacts; acknowledgment and recognition of contributions; learning and personal development opportunities).\n\nThe core categories of potential or realised impact from PPI in research span impacts on individuals (e.g. empowerment, influence), on research quality and relevance and on the wider research system (e.g. accountability for resource-use).\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nThink carefully about who to involve and why.\n\nEnsure roles of PPI contributors are clear and well communicated.\n\nEnsure that PPI contributors are well informed and supported to effectively engage.\n\nThink about ethical considerations.\n\nBuild in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.\n\nReport on the methods used to engage patients and the public and on involvement outcomes.\n\nDesign efforts to recruit and retain patient and public contributors in a way that reflects the diverse factors which motivate them.\n\nConsider the mix of approaches that will allow for effective awareness raising and recruitment.\n\nEnable engagement through a mix of levers.\n\n\n\n\n Related Products \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Project \nPatient and public involvement and engagement in research: Enabling meaningful contributions\n\nFeb 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter One\nBackground and context\n\nChapter Two\nProfile of the reviewed literature\n\nChapter Three\nWhy does patient and public involvement in research happen?\n\nChapter Four\nHow patients and the public are involved in research: an overview of approaches and methods\n\nChapter Five\nHow can effective contributions from patient and public involvement be enabled?\n\nChapter Six\nWhat are the challenges and barriers to patient and public involvement with research?\n\nChapter Seven\nThe impacts of patient and public involvement in research: what we know and what we do not know\n\nChapter Eight\nReflection on key learning points and areas for consideration in future practice\n\nAppendix A\nExamples of patient and public involvement in practice\n\nAppendix B\nStudy design and methods\n\n\n\n\nResearch conducted by\n\nRAND Europe\n\n\n\nThe research described in this report was commissioned by The Healthcare Improvement Studies (THIS) Institute at the University of Cambridge and conducted by RAND Europe.This report is part of the RAND Corporation research report series.
