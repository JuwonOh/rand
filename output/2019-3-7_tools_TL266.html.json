  "abstract": "\n\nThe Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin Delta comprises over 100 islands and tracts northeast of the San Francisco Bay. Most are below sea level and are protected by levees, whereas some are tidal or above sea level. The Delta supports a unique ecosystem, communities, and agricultural land, and plays a key role in the California water distribution system. The flood risks facing the Delta are complex and varied. Some islands are at high risk from flood damage to human life or structures and property, whereas others are at risk of impacting the State's water supply, flooding important habitat, or compromising the Delta's historic towns, prime agricultural land, or public roadways. The possible investments to mitigate these risks are numerous, and they will affect Delta risks differently.\nThe Delta Stewardship Council commissioned the development of a risk modeling framework and decision support tool (DST) to aid in the formulation of a Delta Levees Investment Strategy. The DST is an interactive tool that allows exploration of the data, analysis, and results.\nThe use of the tool, and its methodological basis, are described in the related report Decision Support Tool for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Levees Investment Strategy: Documentation and Use.\nAccess the tool\n\n Related Products \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Report \nDecision Support Tool for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Levees Investment Strategy: Documentation and Use\n\nMar 7, 2019\nDavid G.
