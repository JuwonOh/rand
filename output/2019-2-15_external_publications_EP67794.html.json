  "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate an equilibrium model of private and state college competition that generates realistic pricing patterns for private colleges using a large national data set from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). Our analysis distinguishes between tuition variation that reflects efficient pricing to students who generate beneficial peer externalities and variation that reflects arguably inefficient exercise of market power.

Finally, we conduct policy analysis to examine the consequences of increased availability of quality public colleges in a state.\n\nAccess further information on this document at The RAND Journal of EconomicsThis article was published outside of RAND.
