A recent assessment of America's counterterrorism missions across Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia characterizes them as “sprawling, Whac-A-Mole conflicts…often hidden from public view by successive administrations wary of testing the public's tolerance for unending war and surprising casualties in far-off lands.” The nature of permanent war is such that it cannot be won, only stopped or continued; in the latter case, when it is continued without a discernible objective to guide it, inertia comes to supplant strategy as its principal motor. \nIn view of that reality, as well as the growing strain under which the postwar order finds itself, members of the U.S. foreign-policy establishment widely agree that the Trump administration has been prudent to shift America's focus from counterterrorism to what the Pentagon's national defense strategy calls (PDF) “the reemergence of long-term strategic competition.” The impetus for this recalibration would appear self-evident. A resurgent China has emerged into a formidable economic and technological competitor; continues to consolidate its control over the South China Sea, one of the world's most vital maritime junctures; and is increasingly leveraging national-level political dysfunction in Washington to portray the United States as an unpredictable ally and an unreliable steward of globalization. Russia, meanwhile, has hived off territory in its near abroad, is abetting disintegrationist elements in the European Union, and continues to support Bashar al-Assad's brutal rule in Syria. \nUnfortunately, though, at least as presently conceptualized, great-power competition does not offer much prescriptive guidance. While one can understand the term as a condition (that is, today's world order is increasingly defined by competition between the world's preeminent power and a host of major powers, especially China and Russia) and/or an instrument (that is, Washington must participate in this competition to accomplish certain goals), it does not readily lend itself to a strategy. Noting that there is little understanding of its contours and what the construct “might imply for U.S. national security or U.S. defense policy,” a team of RAND analysts advised late last year that no “country should embark on such a broad-based global competition without a clear sense of the path ahead.” Forging that path will require Washington to answer some basic questions, among them the following four: \nFirst, who is America's principal competitor? The Trump administration's national-security strategy and the aforementioned national-defense strategy often refer to China and Russia jointly. That two countries of such significantly different economic proportions can both be considered great powers—China's gross domestic product in 2017 was nearly eight times as large as Russia's ($12.2 trillion versus $1.6 trillion )—suggests that analysts should delineate more clearly the criteria for earning that designation. Many observers accordingly question the pairing, noting that Beijing is a resurgent, selective revisionist, while Moscow is a faltering, disruptive opportunist. Among this group, most agree that China will pose a greater long-term challenge to Washington. History reminds us, though, that declining powers can pose more acute short-term disturbances. \nSecond, over what specifically is the United States competing? Does it believe that great-power competition extends to every issue area and geographic theater? If so, do its vital national interests suggest a hierarchy of contestation? That is, does Washington deem certain issues and theaters to be more critical than others? While its sheer preponderance of power gives it a singular capacity to elide the necessity for painful strategic choices, a foreign policy that either cannot or refuses to prioritize will inevitably collapse under the weight of its ambition. Strategy, after all, is a necessity that entails the continual reallocation of finite equities, not a luxury that permits the ongoing creation of new ones. Thus, for example, the United States cannot credibly maintain that the Asia-Pacific's evolution is of principal importance to its national interests while concurrently avowing that it must be as engaged in that region as it is in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe.…\nThe remainder of this commentary is available at nationalinterest.org.\n\nAli Wyne is a policy analyst at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation.\nThis commentary originally appeared on The National Interest on February 11, 2019.
