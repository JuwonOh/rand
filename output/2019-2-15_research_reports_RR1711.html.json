  "abstract": "\n\nResearch Question\n\nWhat is the international evidence on best practice in organisational design and governance for a research funding body?\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the UK government set out plans for a new body, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) which will bring together the seven research councils, Innovate UK, and the research functions currently performed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). UKRI will be a Non-Departmental Public Body acting as an overarching research funder. A key consideration for this new funding body will be the design of its structures and governance, so as to best advance its ultimate objectives. To inform the structure and governance of such a body, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (formerly the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills when the report was commissioned), commissioned RAND Europe to conduct a study to review the international evidence on best practice in organisational design and governance for a research funding body? This report synthesises the existing evidence relating to best practice in establishing strong and accountable organisations and governance structures; identifies lessons from the strengths and weaknesses of different organisational models for distributing research funding; and provides a UK context to the analysis.\nKey Findings\n\nThere is no single 'formula' or organisational design structure that prevails in all contexts, however we identified four key themes which should be accounted for: the guiding role of strong and clear strategy; the need to support collaboration and functional networks within and across the organisation; the importance of putting people and organisational culture at the core; and developing structures around concepts of autonomy, trust and a balance of centralised/decentralised functions.\nThough there is no 'one' model which can be lifted, there are governing principles which held true across the evidence base and we develop a framework which integrates these principles together. These principles are: the Haldane Principle; agility and flexibility; openness and transparency; and societal relevance.\nThe study integrates the principles which could be considered in the design, structure and governance of a successful research and innovation organisation and is one of the first that analyses research policy from this perspective. The study shows that if we do not consider both the system and the organisational entity which governs the system together, then we risk missing a piece of the puzzle.\n\n\n\n Related Products \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Project \nOrganising for Excellence\n\nFeb 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter One\nIntroduction\n\nChapter Two\nSummary of the evidence base\n\nChapter Three\nInsights from an integrated evidence base\n\nChapter Four\nConclusion: Applying the analytical framework in practice\n\nAnnex One\nLiterature review methodology\n\nAnnex Two\nInterview protocol\n\n\n\n\nResearch conducted by\n\nRAND Europe\n\n\n\nThis research was conducted by RAND Europe.This report is part of the RAND Corporation research report series.
